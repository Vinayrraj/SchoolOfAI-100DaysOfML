# SchoolOfAI - 100 Days Of ML Code
This repository is a part of #100DaysofMLCode challenge by @llSourcell.  That means I pledge to code machine learning for at least an hour everyday for the next 100 days.

## Project
My pick is [Preventing the Spread of Dengue Fever](https://www.drivendata.org/competitions/44/dengai-predicting-disease-spread/). 
The task is to predict the number of dengue cases each week (in each location) based on environmental variables describing changes
in temperature, precipitation, vegetation, and more. An understanding of the relationship between climate and dengue dynamics can improve research 
initiatives and resource allocation to help fight life-threatening pandemics. You can literally save lives with machine learning.
